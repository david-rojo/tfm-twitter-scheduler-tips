## Use GitHub secret as property

[Github actions not recognizing secret value during build](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66841566/github-actions-not-recognizing-secret-value-during-build)

You have to inform your environment variables for each job.

## Example:

```
 - name: Maven Package 
     env: EMAIL_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_API_KEY }} 
     run: mvn -B clean package
```

## Explanation:

As jobs run in different runners, those runners are in different machines. Each job runs in a fresh instance of the virtual environment specified by runs-on.

It is not possible to share environment variables between machines. Github actions donâ€™t support to share variables between jobs (yet).

However, there are some actions that allows to share datas between jobs using artifacts. You could eventually use it if it makes sense: github.com/marketplace/actions/share-jobs-data
